# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's centralized project management documentation. This folder contains all the process guides, templates, and best practices that guide how we execute projects.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme uses an **iterative, customer-oriented project management approach** that emphasizes:

- **Clear Ownership**: Every project has a dedicated Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Continuous Improvement**: We learn from each project and refine our processes
- **Data-Informed Decision Making**: Success is measured against clear metrics
- **Psychological Safety**: We encourage feedback and collaborative problem-solving

### Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow five key stages:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and define success criteria
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and timelines
3. **Execution & Tracking** — Deliver incrementally with daily standups, reviews, and quality gates
4. **Release & Deployment** — Move features to production safely with validation and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)** — Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)** — Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers** — Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure code quality
- **QA/Testing** — Validate quality and ensure acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders** — Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Communication Cadence

- Daily standups (15 min) — focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- Weekly PM + PdM sync — alignment and priority discussion
- Twice-weekly delivery team standups (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
